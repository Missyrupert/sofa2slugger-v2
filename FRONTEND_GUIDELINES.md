**UI / UX Design System**

## UX Philosophy
- Audio is the authority
- UI is subordinate
- The app must never compete with the audio
- Silence is intentional and valid
- The interface waits

---

## Core UX Rules
- No onboarding
- No tutorials
- No explanations
- No persuasion
- No progress theatre

The user either presses play or they do not.

---

## UI Tone
- Neutral
- Calm
- Undramatic
- Uncelebratory
- Non-judgmental

The UI must never hype, congratulate, or pressure.

---

## Core Screens
- Session list / “gym” screen
- Minimal audio player
- Session completion screen
- Purchase confirmation state

No additional screens are permitted.

---

## Interaction Rules
- No autoplay
- No forced flows
- No countdowns
- No reminders
- No notifications

All movement through the app is explicit and user-initiated.

---

## Copy Rules (Hard Forbiddance)

The app must never use language that implies:
- urgency
- obligation
- comparison
- performance
- discipline
- consistency
- guilt
- motivation

### Explicitly Forbidden Phrases
- “You’re falling behind”
- “Don’t miss a day”
- “Stay consistent”
- “Push yourself”
- “No excuses”
- “Commit”
- “Others are progressing”

---

## Visual Discipline
- Minimal color palette
- No celebratory animations
- No reward states
- No progress bars
- No streak indicators
- No timers

If an element suggests momentum, it violates the product.

---

## Accessibility & Safety
- Clear, readable typography
- Sufficient contrast
- No flashing or aggressive animation
- UI must not distract from physical movement

---

## Final UX Test
If removing a UI element does not break the core interaction,
it should probably be removed.
