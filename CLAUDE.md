## Project Name
**Sofa2Slugger**

---

## Core Product Law
Sofa2Slugger is an **audio-led, authority-driven product**.

UI is subordinate.  
Silence is intentional.  
Restraint is the product.

The app exists to deliver **clear physical instruction**, then get out of the way.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### 1. Documentation Is Authority
If a behavior, feature, or decision is not described in the canonical docs,
it must not be implemented.

Do not infer.  
Do not improve.  
Do not extend.

---

### 2. Core Interaction (Never Change)
**Open → Press play → Obey audio**

- No onboarding
- No configuration
- No setup
- No personalization
- No autoplay

---

### 3. Audio Is the Authority
- Audio gives instructions once
- The app does not monitor compliance
- The app does not react to failure
- The app does not correct behavior
- Silence is a valid and intentional state

---

### 4. Forbidden Features (Absolute)
Never introduce:
- Streaks
- Timers
- Progress bars
- Scores
- Performance metrics
- Notifications
- Scheduling
- Gamification
- Social comparison
- Motivational language
- Behavioral pressure

If a feature simulates momentum, urgency, or obligation, it is forbidden.

---

### 5. Failure & Refusal Are Valid
- User non-compliance is silent and private
- Replaying Session 1 forever is a valid success
- Refusing to purchase is acceptable and intended
- The app never escalates, nudges, or persuades

---

### 6. Safety Boundary
- Audio instructs, user decides
- Pain is never framed as progress
- Audio must instruct users to stop if something feels wrong
- No medical claims or diagnostics

---

### 7. Purchase Ethics
- One-time purchase only
- No dark patterns
- No countdowns
- No urgency copy
- Session 1 sells the programme; the app does not

---

### 8. UI / UX Discipline
- Minimal screens
- Neutral tone
- No celebration
- No shame
- No hype
- No urgency

UI exists only to:
- Start audio
- Confirm completion
- Reveal availability

---

### 9. Build Discipline
- Build only **one step at a time** from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- State which step is being implemented before starting
- Stop after each step for review
- Update progress.txt after every completed step

---

### 10. Memory & Learning Loop
At the start of every session:
- Read this file
- Read progress.txt
- Review lessons.md

After every correction or mistake:
- Update lessons.md
- Add a rule here if needed to prevent recurrence

---

## Summary for AI
If you feel the urge to:
- add features
- explain more
- optimize engagement
- motivate the user
- measure behavior

**Stop. You are violating the product.**

Deliver instruction. Then wait.
