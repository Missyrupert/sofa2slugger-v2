# NOTE: Base directory must be set in Netlify UI:
# - If package.json is at root (/package.json) → Base directory = (empty/root)
# - If package.json is in src/ (src/package.json) → Base directory = "src"
# 
# Current assumption: package.json at root (standard for React Native)
# If package.json is actually in src/, set Base directory to "src" in:
# Netlify → Site settings → Build & deploy → Build settings
