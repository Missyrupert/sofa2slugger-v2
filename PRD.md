## Product Name
**Sofa2Slugger**

## One-Line Description
Sofa2Slugger is a finite, audio-only programme that uses direct physical instruction to bypass thinking and initiate real-world action.

## Problem Statement
Many people remain stuck not because they lack motivation, plans, or insight, but because **thinking has become the gatekeeper to action**. Preparing to act consumes energy; action never begins.

Sofa2Slugger exists to **break inertia through bodily movement**, not cognitive persuasion.

## Target User
- Everyday adults
- No fitness prerequisite
- No boxing experience required
- Individuals who feel mentally stuck, over-analytical, or inert
- Users willing to follow instruction but resistant to motivational content

## Core Insight
> Action does not require belief, readiness, or clarity.  
> Action requires instruction and bodily compliance.

## Core Action (Non-Negotiable)
**Open app → Press play → Obey audio**

This is the only required user action.

## Value Proposition
- No onboarding
- No setup
- No configuration
- No tracking
- No pressure
- No gamification

The product’s value is delivered **entirely through audio instruction and bodily execution**.

## Product Structure
- 10 total sessions
- Audio-only
- Fixed linear sequence
- Session 1 is free
- Sessions 2–10 unlock via one-time purchase (£9.99)

## Session Purpose
- **Session 1:** Initiation (break inertia via movement)
- **Sessions 2–10:** Capability through repetition and increased physical demand

## Success Criteria (Behavioral, Not Emotional)

- Full programme success = user repeatedly obeys physical instruction across sessions
