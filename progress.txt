PROJECT: Sofa2Slugger-v2

COMPLETED:
- Phase 1: Full interrogation complete
- Canonical documentation populated:
  - PRD.md
  - APP_FLOW.md
  - TECH_STACK.md
  - FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md
  - BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Control files populated:
  - CLAUDE.md
  - progress.txt
  - lessons.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 1:
  Project initialized and base folder structure established
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 2:
  Minimal audio player implemented with background playback support
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 3:
  Session 1 audio wired to the player
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 4:
  Session 1 screen implemented with single Play affordance
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 5:
  Session 1 completion screen implemented with passive unlock option
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 6:
  Purchase unlock implemented with local persistence only
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 7:
  Sessions 2–10 list implemented with locked/unlocked states
  - SessionList component shows sessions 1–10
  - Sessions 2–10 visible but inactive before purchase
  - Sessions 2–10 tappable after purchase
  - Explicit tap to play (no autoplay)
  - Sessions 2–10 end in silence (no action button)

IN PROGRESS:
- None

NEXT:
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — Step 8:
  Wire Sessions 2–10 audio files

KNOWN RISKS / WATCHPOINTS:
- Session list UI becoming persuasive
- Accidental autoplay after unlock
- Introducing “next step” pressure

SESSION NOTES:
- Purchase grants access only.
- Refusal remains valid.
- Session 1 stands alone.
